📺 Netflix Clone Project
A sleek, responsive frontend replica of the Netflix homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🚀 Overview
This project is a Netflix homepage clone, built as part of the SmartED 5-Day Netflix Clone Bootcamp. It demonstrates practical frontend development skills, covering everything from structuring web pages to adding interactive features.

📅 Project Breakdown by Bootcamp Days
📌 Day 1: Intro to HTML – Page Structure & Layout
On the first day, we laid the foundation of our Netflix clone by using HTML5 to define the core structure:

Semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer>

Basic layout components such as the hero banner, navigation bar, and movie thumbnails

Organized page elements using clean and meaningful HTML

🎨 Day 2: Styling with CSS – Flexbox, Grids & Fonts
We moved into design by implementing CSS to style the structure:

Used Flexbox and CSS Grid to organize movie rows and layout sections

Integrated Google Fonts for a Netflix-like typography feel

Custom background gradients and hover effects for a premium user interface

🎯 Day 3: Advanced CSS – Responsive Design & Animations
The focus was on making the clone mobile-friendly and visually dynamic:

Media queries ensured a responsive design across phones, tablets, and desktops

Added CSS transitions and keyframe animations for smooth image zoom-ins and button effects

Mobile navbar and movie carousels now adapt beautifully to different screen sizes

✨ Day 4: JavaScript Magic – Interactive Navbar, Buttons & More!
We powered up the clone using JavaScript to make it interactive:

Scroll-triggered navbar background change

Dropdown menu toggle on mobile view

Dynamic movie slider and play buttons with event listeners

🎓 Day 5: Final Touches & Certificate Day!
The final day was about polishing the UI and preparing for deployment:

Debugged and optimized code for performance

Tested responsiveness on multiple devices
